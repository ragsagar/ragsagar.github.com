Atlast i came up with a real rhythmbox plugin for setting the status
message in pidgin as the current song title playing in Rhythmbox music
player .I wrote it a few month before and was using it. Thought of
sharing it before but didnt get time. Actually i forgot about my blog
when i started microblogging. From now onwards i will be updating this
blog regularly.( this is what i wanted to do always :-D ) Download the
plugin from here : http://ragsagar.freehostia.com/rb-nowplaying.tar.gz
To install it. 1) Extract the tarball. 2) Copy it to
~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins/ (if no such directories exists, create
them) 3) Open rhythmbox. Edit -> Plugins 4) Check 'Now Playing Pidgin'
That's it. If you are facing any problems do comment.
