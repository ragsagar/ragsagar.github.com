**E**\ arlier we saw how to setup\ `swanalekha in gentoo!`_ Now lets see
how to setup the same in slackware. Now its pretty easy when compared to
what we have done in gentoo.As gentoo dont have any native binary
package we downloaded the source from `here`_ and installed it.This time
no need to install from source as i made a slackware binary package for
swanalekha which makes the installation a piece of cake ;-) To install
swanalekha, download the binary package from `here`_
``$su #wget http://ragsagar.freehostia.com/swanalekha_0.3.1_2.tgz #installpkg swanalekha_0.3.1_2.tgz``
Hey thats all. We installed swanalekha. Now start typing malayalam in
your computer :-) For More Info on typing malayalam using swanalekha, go
through `this`_ old post. . PS: Make sure that you have **scim** already
installed in your computer.
