will be available by January first or second week. When it became
January there were posts in various unofficial blogs that the results
will be coming out by January 4th. Blogs said that on worst case it will
be postponed to January 5th and they even stated the time University
will be updating it in the database. But days passed, nothing happened.
And this cycle is still going on. I was thinking how much traffic will
they be getting during these days. I just wanted to know how much clicks
they will be getting for using those particular keywords in their posts.
Even if they are providing fake news they will be getting lots of hits.
Even i am checking those blogs twice daily. They are exploiting
students' eagerness to know about their examination results. Let me
check the increase in number of traffic to this blog after posting this.
I will come up with an update to this post if there is considerable
increase in number of clicks. BTW, now one of the University site says
that the results are expected to come out by January 12th. Update: Yeah,
This post did bring more than 100 hits in a single day as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

When i contacted Reliance customer care they told me that &amp;quot;A joke pack
has activated in your account by me last month and this is for the
second time they are taking money,It is not possible to refund the money
now, but they will deactivate it. It is possible to refund the money
only within 24hours after activation of the pack.&amp;quot; I told them that i
didn't activate any such packs and told to deactivate it. On this month
25th i again noticed a decrease in balance by 10rs. So i contacted the
customer care executive on 25th morning. He told that a joke pack has
been subscribed that's why i lost the money and it is possible to refund
the money as no activation has yet taken place.So i told him to refund.
As it didn't got activate after an hour, i contacted the Customer care
again. They told me to wait for 24hours. I waited for 24 hours and
contacted them again on 26th evening and what they said was the same, to
wait for 24hours. Told the same when i called them on 27th. When i
called on 28th one CC executive told me that a complaint has been
registered and that i have to wait for two days and i will be getting
the complaint no as sms. Within two days i got two messages from them
one containing the complaint number and the other informing that the
offer pack has been deactivated. But the money was still not refunded.
So i contacted them on 31st (yesterday), a CC executive told me that i
will be surely refunded within 24hours and told me to wait. Today when i
called them one guy telling me that my pack is not yet deactivated, i
can deactivate it through an sms and it is not possible to refund the
money. WTF??????&lt;/p&gt;

To get
subsidy in interest of educational loan from central govt we have to
give income certificate to the bank. Village officer asked me about my
native. I told him Palakkad. Then he asked about my father's native. i
told him Kottayam. Then he asked me if we have any property there, i
nodded my head and told him we are living here for the past 30 years and
we have nothing left there. He told me to get a report from the village
office in Kottayam that we don't have any property there. Then only he
will give income certificate. i told him several times that we don't
have anything left there and we have property here. But he kept on
saying the same. I should have lied that my father's native is Palakkad.
TIMES I HATE BEING A KOTTAYAM NATIVE&lt;/p&gt;
