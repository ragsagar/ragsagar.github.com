  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Yesterday i went to village office to get income certificate. To get
subsidy in interest of educational loan from central govt we have to
give income certificate to the bank. Village officer asked me about my
native. I told him Palakkad. Then he asked about my father's native. i
told him Kottayam. Then he asked me if we have any property there, i
nodded my head and told him we are living here for the past 30 years and
we have nothing left there. He told me to get a report from the village
office in Kottayam that we don't have any property there. Then only he
will give income certificate. i told him several times that we don't
have anything left there and we have property here. But he kept on
saying the same. I should have lied that my father's native is Palakkad.
TIMES I HATE BEING A KOTTAYAM NATIVE</p>
